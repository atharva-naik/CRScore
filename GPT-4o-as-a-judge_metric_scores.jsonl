The pickle module doesn't support pickling classes defined in the same module, so we have to replace the module name in the pickled data. This is a bit of a hack, but it works.\n\nThe main issue here is that the pickle module doesn't support pickling classes defined in the same module, so we have to replace the module name in the pickled data. This is a bit of a hack, but it works.\n\nYour score: "}
