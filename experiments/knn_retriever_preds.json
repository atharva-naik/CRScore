On the other hand, having this marked `fingerprint=False` means that we won't recreate the `Scheduler` if this value changes... and _that_ is a bug, because the `Scheduler` does consume this option.

That still won't catch the above logic error, but that will be hard to do with a unit test anyway as that method is trying to create a real client.
