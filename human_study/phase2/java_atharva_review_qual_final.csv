### Overall Review
The code changes are quite substantial and it's hard to provide a comprehensive review without knowing the context of the changes. However, the changes seem to be related to OpenSSL, SSL, and AMP (Acoustic Mobile Page).
The code changes are mostly related to memory management, error handling, and code optimization. It's important to ensure that these changes are aligned with the overall design and architecture of the system.
The code changes are also related to the use of OpenSSL, which is a cryptography library. It's important to ensure that these changes are compatible with the security requirements of the system.
The code changes are also related to the use of SSL, which is a protocol for secure communication. It's important to ensure that these changes are compatible with the security requirements of the system.
The code changes are also related to the use of AMP, which is a web development framework. It's important to ensure that these changes are compatible with the requirements of the system.
In conclusion, the code changes are significant and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested before being deployed.",magicoder_pred,,,,,,

The previous code did this by throwing an error when not in UTC. This has been done by creating a conditional statement to check if the time has to be adjusted. The previous code, does not support time without time zone thus is not done accordingly. Also, there is no UUID support in spark dataframe .",codellama_13b_pred,"1,2,4",3,4,3,,
