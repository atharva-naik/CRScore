The code changes are mostly correct and follow best practices. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:
1. The `evp_md_from_dispatch` function should be NULL checked for `md`.
2. The `SSL_SRP_CTX_init` function should be initialized with a memset or similar to avoid leaking sensitive data.
3. The `AmpA4A` class should have a check for `this.iframe` before creating it.

The code changes are mostly correct and follow best practices. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

### Additional Notes
The code changes provided are related to the OpenSSL library and its usage within a Python application. The changes involve modifications to the OpenSSL library itself, as well as related changes in the Python application.
The specific code changes involve updating the OpenSSL library to include a new feature that allows for the specification of a custom name for a message digest. This is achieved by modifying the OpenSSL library's internal data structures and adding a new function that sets the name of the message digest.
Additionally, the Python application includes related changes to the setup and rendering of an iframe element. The changes involve modifying the creation and setup of the iframe element to ensure that it is properly initialized and configured.
The provided feedback suggests that the code changes should be reviewed for potential issues and improvements. In particular, the following suggestions are made:
