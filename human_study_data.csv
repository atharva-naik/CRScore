The code is using a LinkedList, which is a doubly-linked list, and a Queue, which is a collection of elements that are inserted and removed according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.
The LinkedList is a good choice when you need to add or remove elements from the middle of the list, and the Queue is a good choice when you need to add or remove elements from the end of the list.
In this case, the code is using a LinkedList to store the nodes, and a Queue to process the nodes. This is a good choice because the nodes are added to the end of the list and removed from the beginning of the list, which is the standard behavior for a Queue.

The code changes are mostly correct and follow the best practices. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:
1. The `evp_md_from_dispatch` function should be NULL checked for `md`.
2. The `SSL_SRP_CTX_init` function should be memset() of `srp_ctx`.
