The option is named `--strict-tx-replay-protection-enabled` and accepts a boolean value. If not provided, it defaults to `false`. This addition enhances the flexibility of the application by allowing users to control whether transactions should adhere to replay protection rules.\n\nYour score: "}

This interface is intended to facilitate the conversion of Hive primitive objects into objects suitable for use in an Iceberg record. The interface includes a brief description explaining its purpose and how it interacts with the Iceberg ObjectInspector.\n\nHere's a concise review of the suggested code change:\n\n1. **Interface Definition**: The interface `IcebergPrimitiveConverter` is defined with a single method:\n   ```java\n   public interface IcebergPrimitiveConverter {\n       // Method signature\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Method Signature**: The method signature is empty, indicating that the interface does not require any specific implementation details beyond its existence. This is typical for interfaces that serve as contracts or guidelines for implementing classes.\n\n3. **Purpose Explanation**: The comment provides a clear explanation of the interface's purpose:\n   ```\n   If the IcebergObjectInspector does not implement this then the default Hive primitive objects will be used without conversion.\n   ```\n   This comment clarifies that if the `IcebergObjectInspector` does not provide a custom converter, the default Hive primitive objects will be used instead.\n\n4. **Consistency**: The interface name `IcebergPrimitiveConverter` is consistent with the naming convention for interfaces in Java, which typically start with an uppercase letter.\n\nOverall, the code snippet is well-structured and provides a clear definition of the interface's purpose and behavior. It serves as a foundation for implementing custom converters that can handle specific data types when working with Hive and Iceberg records.\n\nYour score: "}

A relevant review is one which is both concise and comprehensive. A concise review contains very little text not related to the code change. A comprehensive review contains all the information about a code change that should be covered by a review. A relevant review is comprehensive while being concise.\n\nNow look at the code change and review below and score the relevance of the review on a scale of 1 to 5\n\nCode Change:\n@@ -116,8 +116,13 @@ class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):\n     def load(self):\n         if os.path.exists(self._state_path):\n             logger.info(\"Attempting to load state from %s\", self._state_path)\n-            with open(self._state_path) as fobj:\n-                state = pickle.load(fobj)\n+            try:\n+                with open(self._state_path) as fobj:\n+                    state = pickle.load(fobj)\n+            except:\n+                logger.exception(\"Error when loading state.

If an exception occurs during this process, it logs an error message and returns without attempting to use the loaded state. This approach ensures that the program can handle errors gracefully and start fresh if the state file is corrupted or missing.\n\n**Review:**\n- **Graceful Error Handling:** The use of a `try-except` block allows the program to continue running even if there's an issue with loading the state file.\n- **Logging:** The `logger.exception` method provides detailed logging of the error, which can be useful for debugging purposes.\n- **Return Statement:** The function returns immediately after logging the error, ensuring that no further operations are performed on the potentially corrupted state.\n- **Simplicity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, making it maintainable and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, this change enhances the robustness of the program by handling potential errors gracefully and providing clear feedback in case of issues.\n\nYour score: "}
